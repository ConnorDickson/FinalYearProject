Once I reached this point I had already had quite a lot of experience with Nodejs so there were not as many references needed apart from JSON

I used this;

http://jsfiddle.net/bkanber/hevFK/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=hevFK
as a basis for the Nearest Neighbor code. It needed to be altered for movies and to fit into a Nodejs envionment.
